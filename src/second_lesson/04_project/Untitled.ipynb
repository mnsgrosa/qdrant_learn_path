    "# Section project: Semantic search\n",
    "\n",
    "## What will be built:\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll take detailed movie descriptions and apply the chunking strategies you learned earlier, embed those chunks using sentence transformers, and store them in Qdrant with rich metadata. The result is a search engine that understands themes, moods, and concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project synthesizes everything from today: points and vectors, distance metrics, payloads, chunking strategies, and embedding models. By the end, you’ll have a working system that can find movies by plot, theme, or emotional resonance.\n",
    "\n",
    "A semantic search engine that can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand meaning: Search for “time travel and family relationships” and find Interstellar\n",
    "- Compare chunking strategies: See how fixed-size, sentence-based, and semantic chunking affect search quality\n",
    "- Filter intelligently: Combine semantic search with metadata filters (year, genre, rating)\n",
    "- Handle constraints: Process long movie descriptions that exceed embedding model token limit\n",
    "- Group results: Avoid duplicate movies when multiple chunks match your query\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Understanding the challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset consists of 13 science fiction movies with detailed, literary descriptions. Here’s the challenge: each description contains 240-460 tokens, but our embedding model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) can only embed 256 tokens or less.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: The Three-Vector Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s what makes this demo unique: we’ll create three different vector spaces in a single collection, each representing a different chunking strategy. This lets us directly compare how chunking affects search quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Side note: Creating three different vector spaces in a single collection is almost as expensive as having one collection per vector space. We do it here purely for comparison convenienc\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\n",
    "from qdrant_client import QdrantClient, models\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize components\n",
    "encoder = SentenceTransformer(\"all-MiniLM-L6-v2\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# In-memory for demo: NO HNSW built -> queries are a full scan.\n",
    "client = QdrantClient(\":memory:\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# For ANN/HNSW:\n",
    "# client = QdrantClient(url=\"http://localhost:6333\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create collection with three named vectors\n",
    "client.create_collection(\n",
    "    collection_name='movie_search',\n",
    "    vectors_config={\n",
    "        'fixed': models.VectorParams(size=384, distance=models.Distance.COSINE),\n",
    "        'sentence': models.VectorParams(size=384, distance=models.Distance.COSINE),\n",
    "        'semantic': models.VectorParams(size=384, distance=models.Distance.COSINE),\n",
    "    },\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fixed: 40 tokens per chunk\n",
    "- Sentence: sentence-aware chunks with overlap\n",
    "- Semantic: Meaning-aware\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Implementing the Chunking Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s where the chunking concepts from earlier lessons come alive. We’ll implement three different approaches and see how they perform\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Processing and Uploading the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "For each movie description, we apply all three chunking strategies, embed the resulting chunks, and store them with their respective vector names\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Comparing Search Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Now comes the fascinating part: testing how different chunking strategies affect search quality. Let’s create a helper function to compare results\n",
